Programming at the Club is a lot different this summer due to COVID-19.

Every week we are offering activities to develop SEL (Social/Emotional Learning), S.T.E.A.M. activities, and more! Programming is developed for two age groups: Elementary and 6th grade and up.

Due to the guidelines from the Oregon Health Authority and the Early Learning Division, we are offering programming to five groups of ten youth. If you are interested in having your youth attend our facility, please call our office at 541.680.9505 to see if there are any openings or to be put on our waitlist.
