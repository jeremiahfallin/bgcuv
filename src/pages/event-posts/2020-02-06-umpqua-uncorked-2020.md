Umpqua Uncorked & On Tap is the only age 21 and over annual Club event, and features local wines and beers from around the Umpqua Valley. The event includes a wonderful meal, your choice of beverages to sample, camaraderie with friends and neighbors, live music, a silent auction, and more.

The Club is dedicated to providing fun, educational and outcome-driven programs for youth 1st -12th grade throughout the year. All the proceeds from this event go to support summer and after-school Club programs. In addition to the school year, it’s important to keep kids learning throughout the summer to help prevent summer learning loss, and help them to be prepared for the next school year.

More:
A funding gap exists due to the Club’s low $52.00 annual membership fee. The actual cost for each child member reaches more than $800.00 annually, and community support is what helps to significantly decrease the difference. By purchasing tickets for this event each year, or becoming a sponsor, you are personally helping us keep the cost affordable and provide scholarships to those children and families that need us most.
