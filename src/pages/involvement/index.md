### Be Someone to Someone

Whether it's through volunteering or joining our team of employees, this organization runs on people. People who believe in our mission and who enjoy working in an energetic atmosphere around youth.

### Volunteer Opportunities

Everybody who was ever anyone had a someone. A teacher, a coach, a mentor, a friend. Someone who stood at a crucial crossroads and pointed the way.
Could you be that someone?
Could you spare a few hours to make a difference in the life of a child?

If you're interested in joining our team, please call or visit our office Monday - Friday between 8am and 5pm to ask about opportunities.
