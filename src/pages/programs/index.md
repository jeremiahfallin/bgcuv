# Educational Success

Our educational programs assist youth in becoming more successful in school by offering homework assistance, educational support programming and developing a love for lifetime learning.

## Learning Center

Power Hour promotes academic success and helps Club members become more successful in school by providing homework help and tutoring and encouraging members to become self-directed learners. The program develops homework helpers and tutors, and tracks participation by the minute to reward each participant’s progress.

Project Learn reinforces and enhances the skills and knowledge young people learn at school during the hours they spend at the Club. This comprehensive program strategy is based on Dr. Reginald Clark’s research showing that students do much better in school when they spend their non-school hours engaged in fun, but academically beneficial, activities. Through Project Learn, Club staff use all the areas and programs in the Club to create opportunities for these high-yield learning activities, which include leisure reading, writing activities, discussions with knowledgeable adults, helping others, homework help, tutoring and games like Scrabble that develop young people’s cognitive skills. Project Learn also emphasizes parent involvement and collaboration between Club and school professionals as critical factors in creating the best after school learning environment for Club members.

## Tech Center

Skill Tech is a basic computer skills program that develops Club members’ proficiency with word processing, spreadsheet and other productivity software through fun, hands-on, engaging lessons and projects for four age groups.Skill Tech II teaches advanced yet practical technology skills to Club members. Using animated, interactive tutorials on courseware developed exclusively for Boys & Girls Clubs, as well as hands-on, instructor-led group activities, the program introduces members to hardware and networking skills and technology-related career opportunities.

# Character & Citizenship

Programs in this area empower youth to become responsible, caring citizens, sustain meaningful relationships with others, develop a positive self-image, develop leadership skills, participate in the democratic process and respect their own and others’ cultural identities.

## Keystone & Torch Clubs

Torch Clubs is a chartered small-group leadership and service club for members who are ages 11-13. A Torch Club is a powerful vehicle through which Club staff can help meet the special character development needs of younger adolescents at a critical stage in their development. Torch Club members learn to elect officers and work together to implement activities in four areas: service to Club and community, education, health and fitness and social recreation. Implementing information learned from the Club’s Healthy Habits program, our Torch Club recently developed a listing of healthy snack alternatives to incorporate into their monthly Snack Shack concession.

Keystone Club is the Boys & Girls Club’s most dynamic teen program. It affords teens an opportunity to gain valuable leadership and service experience. Keystone members conduct activities in three areas: academic success, career exploration and community service. Our Keystone Club raises funds for their activities by providing concessions at Roseburg Sports Program sporting events. The members then decide what projects and activities they wish to fund. Projects may focus on internal Club needs or support worthy community programs.

Sports Leadership Team Club members who are 4th grade and older and exhibit positive qualities throughout the Clubhouse are encouraged to become an assistant to the gym staff. Gym Helpers are selected based on their honesty, helpfulness, fairness, good sportsmanship, respect for others and their communication skills. They wear special jerseys to identify them as leaders. They learn about gym safety, how to keep the equipment room clean and organized, and the process used for checking out gym equipment.

# Healthy Lifestyles

Our health & life skills programs develop young people’s capacity to engage in positive behaviors that nurture their own well-being, set personal goals and live successfully as self-sufficient adults.

## Wellness & Prevention

We promote wellness as a part of our goal to teach healthy lifestyles to our members. Our wellness philosophy, originally promoted through Triple Play, extends to our staff and is now being incorporated into all areas of our Clubhouse programming. A wellness/prevention coordinator, who teaches Healthy Habits and SMART Moves, conducts research and training for staff and Club families.

## SMART Moves Skills Mastery And Resistance Training

This nationally acclaimed comprehensive prevention program helps young people resist alcohol, tobacco and other drug use. SMART Moves features engaging, interactive, small-group activities that increase participants’ peer support, enhance their life skills, build their resiliency and strengthen their leadership skills. This year-round program encourages collaborations among Club staff, youth, parents and representatives from other community organizations.

## Healthy Habits

Designed to incorporate healthy living and active learning in every part of the Club experience, Healthy Habits emphasizes good nutrition, regular physical activity and improving overall well-being. Healthy Habits is the “mind” portion of the Triple Play program, so youth who participate are required to participate in both the games room and gym curriculum along with the classroom learning.

## Food Program

The Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) is a federally-funded program that provides meal reimbursement for serving nutritious meals and snacks to all children in various programs, including after school programs. Program requirements include menu planning, food preparation, food service sanitation, record keeping and meal pattern requirements. The Club participates in both the CACFP and Summer Food/Nutrition Programs. During the school year, Club members enjoy “snupper”— a suppersized after school snack. During summer, the Club serves a full lunch and an afternoon snack to Club members. Our free summer lunch program is open to any youth in our community ages 1 – 18.

# Fitness & Recreation

## Triple Play — An answer to America’s Physical Fitness Crisis.

Triple Play, is an exciting fitness, nutrition, and dynamic wellness program offered at the Boys & Girls Club of the Umpqua Valley. The program demonstrates how eating right, keeping fit and forming positive relationships add up to a healthy lifestyle. The goal of the Triple Play program is to improve Club members’ knowledge of healthy living; increase the number of hours per day they participate in physical activities; and strengthen their ability to interact positively with others and engage in positive relationships.

Triple Play embodies fitness (body), education (mind), and sportsmanship (soul). Mind develops a knowledge base for young people to acquire healthy habits, such as making smart food choices, understanding appropriate portion sizes and creating fun and balanced meals. Body promotes young people becoming more physically active through fun daily fitness, including activities to get kids active and moving. Soul strengthens interpersonal skills, positive behavior and good character through social recreation programs and activities.

# Teen Programs

For our members ages 13 years and older, the Club has a dedicated Teen Center and Teen Programs Coordinator. Our goal is to provide a safe, positive environment for teens often making the choice between hanging out with friends on the streets or hanging out with friends at the Club. In addition to providing teen nights and dances, the programs encourage camaraderie, acceptance, safety and supportive staff.

## Diplomas 2 Degrees

Diplomas 2 Degrees (d2D) is Boys & Girls Club of America’s (BGCA) college readiness, access and success program, which provides a range of services to help guide Club members through high school graduation and make plans for post-secondary education and career success.

Group sessions center around information and activities in the Teen Personal Finance Guide — a fun, interactive booklet containing practical tips and activities to help teens learn the important skills of balancing a checkbook, creating a budget, saving, investing and paying for college.

## Youth for Unity

The goal of Youth for Unity is to engage members in activities designed to promote diversity and combat prejudice, bigotry and discrimination. The program consists of activities to help teen members:

1. appreciate themselves as unique and special individuals;
2. understand our society’s diversity;
3. recognize bias and unfairness; and
4. take personal leadership in confronting bias.

## Teen Volunteer Program

Members who are age 14 or older are encouraged to volunteer at the Club. In order to do so, they must apply and be “offered” a volunteer position. Teen volunteers help in program areas and with various projects at the Club. Wearing volunteer vests while they are on duty, teen volunteers help in many ways, including assisting staff in program areas, in the Kids Café and/or with sports events.
