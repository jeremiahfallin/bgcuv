**Formerly the Roseburg Sports Program, BGCUV Athletics has been managed by the Boys & Girls Club since 2000. BGCUV Athletics organizes league play in volleyball, co-ed flag football, co-ed bowling, and girls & boys basketball for students in the Roseburg elementary and middle schools. The sports program strives to offer a sports experience that is safe and fun for ALL children where the emphasis is on skill-building, teamwork and participation.**

# Please note the insurance requirement:

**All athletes in BGCUV Athletics are required to be insured against injuries which may occur during athletic participation. The Boys & Girls Club requires your insurance information as assurance that your child has adequate accident insurance coverage that will be in effect for the duration of their athletic participation.**

## BGCUV Athletics Opportunities

Please Note: Confirmed dates for youth sports registrations are found on the registration forms. If registration forms are not found on this webpage, no registrations are open at this time.

## Important Notice:

Safety for our youth athletes is top priority. Air quality occasionally requires practices to take place indoors. We suggest parents contact their child’s coach for updates on team practices.
[For details about air quality and the affects, click here.](http://www.osaa.org/docs/health-safety/AirQualityIndexMemo.pdf)

## Scholarships

Sports scholarships are available if your child qualifies for the free or reduced fee lunch program through the Roseburg School District. A copy of your eligibility letter is required at the time of registration.

## Officials & Site Supervisors

The Boys & Girls Club hires and trains officials and site supervisors for each sports season to support the play of our athletes. Officials & supervisors are expected to have knowledge of the game, meet Club standards and pass a criminal background check.

## Fee Policy

Members registration fee must be paid in full at the time of registration. Members are not allowed to participate in activities until registration is paid.
