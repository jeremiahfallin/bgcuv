    Our heartfelt thanks goes out to the following businesses and individuals who provide support for our events, sports and educational Club programs. We hope that, when you have a chance, you will choose to do business with these community-minded businesses who support the youth of our community! The Club is fortunate to receive support from several promotions offered by local businesses. During the months listed, these businesses will be offering a special promotion that benefits your local Boys & Girls Club. We hope you’ll plan on participating in these promotions — it’s another way you can support the youth of our community!
