1. Due to the guidelines, we are still limited on the number of youth we are able to serve.

3. We will only be offering on side programs for grades 1st through 7th at this time.

4. We are doing a sliding scale to determine the monthly cost of programming and the following Documentation for your household that is needed for sign-up is as follows: Income Tax Return, last 2 months of paycheck stubs or any other income documentation(i.e. statement of unemployment benefits,social security benefit letter, public assistance benefits letter or foster papers). You will only need 1 of these items from every person in the household. Only the family size and annual income will be used to determine your eligibility and to calculate your discount. If you chose to not provide proof of income you will automatically be put in the highest monthly rate. All documentation information is kept confidential and we will only visually look at the documents, none of these will be kept or copied.

To sign up for a new clubhouse membership please complete the forms under Membership Forms and provide proof of income listed under bullet 4, then submit payment to The Boys & Girls Club of the Umpqua.
